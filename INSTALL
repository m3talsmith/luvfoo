# How to install Luvfoo #

1. Start by making sure your RubyGems are version 1.2.0 or greater:

        sudo gem update --system

2. Add the Github repository to your gems:

        sudo gem sources -a http://gems.github.com

3. Luvfoo runs on Ruby on Rails, so first you need to get Rails running. In order to do that, download Rails from the [Ruby on Rails site] or install though gems:

        sudo gem install rails -v=2.1.1

4. Copy config/database.yml.example to config/database.yml and edit it to reflect the database names you would like to use.

5. Copy config/global_config.yml.example to config/global_config.yml and edit it to reflect your application customized configurations.

6. Copy config/environments/production.rb.example to config/environments/production.rb and edit `asset_host` in order to reflects the name of the production asset server.

7. Configure your mail settings inside of production.rb ie:

    ActionMailer::Base.delivery_method = :smtp
    ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings = {
      :address => "mail.luvfoo.com",
      :port => 25,
      :domain => "luvfoo.com",
      :authentication => :login,
      :user_name => "demo@luvfoo.com",
      :password => "sweet"
    }

8. You will need to install some 3th party softwares. Above, there is the command to install them in Ubuntu and other Debian-based Linux distribuitions:

        sudo apt-get install gettext
        
              or in OSX 10.5
              
        sudo gem install gettext

9. luvfoo currently has a few dependencies that prevent a basic rake from running. We need to install the following:

        sudo gem install mini_magick
        sudo gem install hpricot
        sudo gem install gcnovus-avatar
        
    Now you should be able to run rails built in rake tasks to include the rest.
        
        sudo rake gems:install

10. Run the following commands to create the database, the tables and then populate them with default data:

        rake db:create
        rake db:schema:load
        
11. We need to get solr running before you can populate the database:

        mkdir tmp/pids
        mkdir tmp/pids/solr
        rake solr:start

12. Now we can populate the database:

        rake luvfoo:db:populate

13. Start the server with:

        script/server

14. Go to http://localhost:3000/ and login with username `admin` and password `admin`. Change it ASAP.

15. Have fun with *Luvfoo*!
