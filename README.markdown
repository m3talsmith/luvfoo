Luvfoo is a platform for niche social networks.  Currently it powers TeachersWithoutBorders.org.  We are working on generalizing the platform to make it easier for 3rd party use.

See Roadmap.html for more information about the direction the project is taking.

Luvfoo is a fork of the lovdbyless project.
